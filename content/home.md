I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Politics at Princeton University. My dissertation, “Trade Policy in the Shadow of Power,” seeks to understand how military coercion affects the structure of the international economy -- who is rich, who is poor, and who trades with whom. In another line of research, I study exchange and violence in black markets. I am a graduate fellow affiliated with the [Program in Quantitative and Analytical Political Science (Q-APS)](https://qaps.princeton.edu/) at Princeton and teach the Politics Department’s summer math course for incoming graduate students, along with [Daniel Gibbs](http://www.daniel-gibbs.com/). Before coming to Princeton I worked at the [Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments](http://csbaonline.org/) in Washington D.C. and studied Political Science and Peace, War, & Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

- Gunshots and Turf Wars: Inferring Gang Territories from Shooting Reports

> with [Noam Reich](http://noamreich.com/). *Last updated 24 April 2020.*

{{%expand Abstract %}}
Street gangs are conjectured to engage in violent territorial competition. This competition can be difficult to study empirically as the number of gangs and the division of territory between them are usually unobserved to the analyst. However, traces of gang conflict manifest themselves in police and administrative data on violent crime. In this paper, we show that the frequency and location of shootings are sufficient statistics number of gangs in operation and the territorial partition beween them under mild assumptions about the data generating processes for gang-related and non-gang related shootings. We then show how to estimate this territorial partition from a panel of geolocated shooting data. We apply our method to analyze the structure of gang territorial competition in Chicago using victim-based crime reports from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and validate our methodology on gang territorial maps produced by the CPD. We detect the presence of 3-4 gangs whose estimated territorial footprints we match to CPD maps. After matching, 56-60 percent of our partition labels agree with those of the CPD. This performance compares favorably to an agreement rate of 35 percent when CPD labels are randomly permuted.

- Estimating Policy Barriers to Trade

> *Last updated 20 April 2020.*

{{%expand Abstract %}}
To what extent is international trade free and fair? Because policy barriers to trade are often opaque and take on many forms, it is difficult to answer this question while relying on data on observable trade barriers. Here, I propose and implement a structural approach to estimating the magnitude of policy barriers to trade, measured at the trade partner level. The method allows for the possibility that these barriers are both *asymmetric* and *discriminatory*, affecting certain trade partners disproportionately. The approach reveals substantial latent policy barriers to trade, many times larger than observed tariffs. It also implies substantial effective policy discrimination, with exporters in subset of favored countries enjoying far superior market access conditions than their peers in unfavored countries. Combined, these results suggest that the existing world trading system remains far from a free and fair ideal.

- Gunboat Diplomacy: Political Bias, Trade Policy, and War

> *Last updated 13 November 2019.*

{{%expand Abstract %}}
Countries with deep trading relationships rarely fight wars with one another. Here, I develop a theory of trade, war, and political bias, in which both trade and war are endogenous objects. Governments can rectify poor market access conditions abroad through war and subsequent regime change, in which the victorious country installs a liberal "puppet" government abroad. Trade policy bargaining is therefore conducted "in the shadow of power," with counterfactual wars shaping the policy choices that prevail in times of peace. When peace prevails, militarily weak countries are more open to trade than powerful ones, all else equal. Equilibrium trade policies balance domestic interests against military threats from abroad. War is less likely between liberal governments because they prefer less protectionist trade policies. As a result, trade flows and the probability of peace are positively correlated in equilibrium, even though trade does not cause peace.

### Works in Progress

- Trade Policy in the Shadow of Power: Quantifying Military Coercion in the International System

{{%expand Abstract %}}
In international relations, how does latent military coercion affect governments’ policy choices? Because militarily powerful governments can credibly threaten to impose their policy preferences by force, weaker governments may adjust their policy choices to avoid costly conflict. This setting raises an inference problem -- do observed policies reflect the preferences of the governments that adopted them or the military constraints of the anarchic international system? Here, I investigate the role of this “shadow of power” in determining trade policy. Specifically, I build a model of trade policy choice under threat that allows me to measure empirically governments’ underlying trade policy preferences and the magnitude of policy appeasement attributable to latent military coercion. Once estimated, the model can be used to conduct counterfactual experiments – such as assessing the international economic effects of Chinese military growth or the military strategic effects of Chinese political liberalization. These and other exercises shed light on how military power affects international economic exchange, and how expectations about exchange affect governments’ military strategies.
