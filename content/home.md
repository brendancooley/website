Welcome! I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Politics at Princeton University and a graduate student fellow in [The Program for Quantitative and Analytical Political Science (Q-APS)](https://q-aps.princeton.edu/). I study the relationship between international economics and militarized conflict, in particular how military coercion affects trade policy. Before coming to Princeton I worked at the [Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments](http://csbaonline.org/) in Washington D.C. and studied Political Science and Peace, War, & Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

## Research

**Working Papers**

- Estimating Policy Barriers to Trade

> **Abstract:** To what extent is international trade free and fair? Because policy barriers to trade are often opaque and take on many forms, it is difficult to answer this question while relying on data on observable trade barriers. Here, I propose and implement a structural approach to estimating the magnitude of policy barriers to trade, measured at the trade partner level. The method allows for the possibility that these barriers are both *asymmetric* and *discriminatory*, affecting certain trade partners disproportionately. The approach reveals substantial latent policy barriers to trade, many times larger than observed tariffs. It also implies substantial effective policy discrimination, with exporters in subset of favored countries enjoying far superior market access counditions than their peers in unfavored countries. Combined, these results suggest that the existing world trading system remains far from a free and fair ideal.

- Trade Policy in the Shadow of Power

> **Abstract:** Does military coercion affect the trade policies governments adopt in times of peace? Here, I marry a simple domestic political economy of trade, inspired by Grossman and Helpman (1994, 1995), with an international model of bargaining and war (Fearon 1995). I then explore how changes in economic and political primitives affect the bargaining environment when governments have both militarized and non-militarized tools to pursue their policy objectives. The model demonstrates that the magnitude of bilateral conflicts of interest and governments' optimal level of military investment vary dramatically as a function of whose welfare the governments maximize. Those that value social welfare generate smaller externalities, yielding largely harmonious and unmilitarized international relations, while those that maximize rents seek to impose large externalities on their neighbors and maintain large militaries. The model provides firm political-economic foundations for other studies linking government bias to patterns of international conflict (Lake 1992, Jackson and Morelli 2007).
